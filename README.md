# STOCK-MARKET-INDICES-PREDICTION-USING-NEWS-HEADLINES
Stock prices are hard to predict based on some expertise through previous trends or past prices and hence need the help of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. The volatility of stock prices depends on gains or losses of certain companies. News articles are one of the most important factors which influence the stock market. So for an efficient analysis of the current trends, new companyâ€™s product information, business growth etc., we propose to look at the daily news which represents factual information about the companies which could be ultimately used to predict the stock prices. Hence, we will be using news articles to predict the change in stock indices rather than predicting the prices by historical stock prices. We plan to perform sentiment analysis of the headlines and understand the investing insight through the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock, after which the output will be fed to various machine learning models to predict whether the price of stock indices will go up or not.
